# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository. Process-level conventions (Notion workflow, PR policy, documentation standards, token
efficiency, activity logging) live in the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and apply here unchanged --
this file only covers what's specific to this project.

## Project overview

This repo is a Docker-based runtime environment for Odoo 19.0 (Community edition). It currently
contains no custom addons — `addons/` is empty and is where custom Odoo modules should be placed
as they are developed. There is no application code yet; the repo is infrastructure/config only.

## Architecture

- `docker-compose.yml` defines two services:
  - `db` — Postgres 16, credentials `odoo`/`odoo`, data persisted in the `db-data` volume.
  - `odoo` — official `odoo:19.0` image, depends on `db`, exposed on host port `8070` (not `8069` — the v18 sibling project already occupies that port on this machine when both stacks run locally).
- `odoo.conf` is bind-mounted into the container at `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf`. Its `addons_path`
  includes both `/mnt/extra-addons` (mapped from local `./addons`) and Odoo's built-in addons
  path. Any custom module placed in `./addons/<module_name>/` becomes available to Odoo without
  further config changes.
- `./addons` is bind-mounted to `/mnt/extra-addons` in the container — this is the sole
  integration point between this repo and custom module code.
- Odoo application data (filestore, sessions) persists in the `odoo-data` named volume, separate
  from the addons source in this repo.

## Common commands

```bash
# Start the stack (Postgres + Odoo) in the background
docker compose up -d

# Follow Odoo logs
docker compose logs -f odoo

# Stop the stack
docker compose down

# Restart Odoo only (e.g. after adding/updating an addon) with module upgrade
docker compose exec odoo odoo -u <module_name> -d <database_name> --stop-after-init
docker compose restart odoo

# Open a shell inside the Odoo container
docker compose exec odoo bash
```

Odoo is reachable at `http://localhost:8070` once the stack is up; the first run prompts for
database creation through the web UI.

## Notes for adding custom modules

- New addons go under `addons/<module_name>/` with a standard Odoo module layout
  (`__manifest__.py`, `models/`, `views/`, etc.) — no changes to `odoo.conf` or
  `docker-compose.yml` are needed for a new module to be picked up.
- After adding or changing a module, upgrade/install it with `-u`/`-i` as shown above, or use
  Odoo's Apps UI, then restart the `odoo` service so changes take effect.

## Testing

Dev database: `harsh-test-v19`. Command patterns (test run, manual REPL, test file conventions) come from the `odoo-conventions:odoo-module-dev` skill (the shared `odoo-conventions` plugin) -- substitute `harsh-test-v19` for its `<dev_database>` placeholder.

## Codebase conventions

- Existing customizations: search `addons/` for the relevant Odoo model/field/view names before assuming something doesn't already exist.
- Local index: check `.claude/context/odoo-modules-index.md` first -- it tracks every shipped module, the model(s) it touches, its ticket/Release Note link, and any quirks worth remembering. Cheaper than a full `addons/` scan or a Release Notes query; only fall back to those if the index is missing, incomplete, or stale.

## What counts as code

Code (always needs a branch + PR + review, no exceptions): anything in `addons/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `odoo.conf`.

Pure documentation/context (can push directly to master, after showing the human the diff): `.claude/context/*`, this `CLAUDE.md`, skill files under `.claude/skills/`.

## Deploying an update

Dev database: `harsh-test-v19` (same as "Testing" above). Command pattern comes from the `odoo-conventions:odoo-module-dev` skill; it also carries the cache-busting reminder (Odoo's asset bundles are cached aggressively -- hard-refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R after deploying).

## Environments

`local` only — the Docker stack on this machine (see "Deploying an update"). No staging or production exists for this project; a merged PR deployed locally is fully shipped.

## Visibility

personal — this is Harsh's own Odoo testbed ("Odoo v19 Community Test"), not a client engagement. Its shipped work may be mined for public content (LinkedIn, showcase) in full technical detail, per the global Content Pipeline ground rules.

## Ticket workflow for this project

Standard global pipeline (see "The ticket pipeline" in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`); this project's build skill (step 2) is `odoo-conventions:odoo-module-dev`, the shared type-tier plugin.
